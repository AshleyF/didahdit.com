# Morse Code site - didahdit.com

I building a little site for learning Morse Code, abbreviations and codes for ham radio CW QSOs.
Here are some ideas and nice sites and apps out there:

## Ideas

- A Duolingo-like, gamified site with a social aspect. Maybe even with a woodpecker mascot!
- Purely audio to letters and fist/sound to letters. No visual dits and dahs!
- Simulated static and interference (a la G4FON).
- Simulated QSOs.
- Automatic increase/decrease speed with success/failure.

## Sites

- [*Long Island CW Club*](https://longislandcwclub.org) A wonderful group of people and site with good resources.
- [*CWOpps*](https://cwops.org/) Older group of people, an academy, and great resources.
- [*morsle.fun*](https://morsle.fun/) A Wordle-like Morse Code game. I suggest selecting "Hard Mode" in settings to hide the key.
- [*G4FON*](http://www.g4fon.net/) A nice site and a set of interesting (old) apps.
- [Morse Code Ninja](https://morsecode.ninja/).

## Apps

- *Morse Machine* [for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/morse-machine/id1455507957) or [for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iu4apc.morsemachine&hl=en_US&gl=US).
- [MorseZapp](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/morsezapp-learn-morse-code/id1397107048) for iOS. Not free, but this one is addictive to me for some reason. The urgency as the letters fall seems to keep me strictly engaged.
- [RufzXP](https://www.rufzxp.net/) for Windows. Copy callsigns with automatic 3% increase/descrease in speed, depending on how you're doing.
