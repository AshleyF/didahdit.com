# v1 Arduino Morse Decoder

This is a very simple Arduino build of a sounder and LCD screen to display decoding. It displays the dits and dahs on the second row while showing the decoding on the first.

I've added connectors for a paddle and to a radio, a transistor to key the radio, and a serial interface with the web page to display what's being keyed and to send text to be keyed on the radio.
